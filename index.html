Brief Description of Goal of Code:
In this app, the main goal is to:
	Create an HTML5 drawing canvas (with a border around it) in your app that fits on phoneâ€™s screen.
	put a button under the canvas that, when pressed, draws a rectangle on the canvas.
	make another button that puts your name on the canvas.
	make another button that loads an image of something onto the canvas.
	put one last button that clears the canvas when pressed.

Known Issues:
The main purpose is issue for this app is to make a more user-friendly app. The images, figures, and pictures will help users to use this app more easily.
